## Motivation
After watching [Meth Meth Method's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2aW5V46khA) I was inspired to create a similar game for the following reasons:

  1. To try my hand at making a game using functional programming methodologies.
  1. To try out some JS tools that I hadn't used before
  1. I thought it would be fun to make up crazy custom shapes and/or game modes.

Some of the tools I used:

  - [redux](http://redux.js.org/) for state management
  - [reselect](https://github.com/reactjs/reselect) for memoized selectors
  - [react](https://facebook.github.io/react/) for component rendering
  - [Ducks](https://github.com/erikras/ducks-modular-redux) for module organization
  - [AVA](https://github.com/avajs/ava) for unit tests and [nyc](https://github.com/istanbuljs/nyc) for code coverage
  - [lodash](https://lodash.com/) for numerous utility functions
  - [random-seed](https://github.com/skratchdot/random-seed) to create a deterministic game mode (where every game is the same order of pieces)
  - [pressed](https://github.com/mimshwright/pressed.js) for detecting key presses in update loop (I created this library for this project)
  - babel, webpack, standard (code style)
  - ES6
